//Use this jsPsych experiment control script to replicate Validation Experiment 1 reported in Krause, Pili, Fernandez, & Hunt (Submitted).
//If using Cognition.run, include only the JavaScript portion as source code, but verify that any supplementary scripts not included as part of 
//the jsPsych standard library are attached to your Task.

//The jsPsych initialization function below includes a function to save data to the local computer as a .csv file. This is handy for testing the script on a local machine. However, 
//it should be removed if running the experiment online. If using your own server, you will need to write php syntax to save the data. If using Cognition.run, 
//the data will save to your Task automatically.
